# text-calendar-generator

I learnt this text calendar from Brian Kernighan's course website  
[cos333](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos333/). 
I really like it so I write this calendar generator. 

# TO DO
Learn to how to use 'nosetests' to write unit tests in Python.

Make it work for multiple dates.
